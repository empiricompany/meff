The purpose of this utility is to list all the files responsible for a Magento extension and their locations. Think of it as an experiment in building a automatic modman file generator. Key word "experiment" :)

#### Usage:
Simple clone this repo and run the meff.php file via the command line passing it a extension name and full path to your Magento root directory.
```bash
php meff.php Extension_Name MagentoDir

# or if you are in the current working directory
php meff.php Extension_Name
```
You can also install this via modman:
```bash
modman clone https://github.com/empiricompany/meff.git
```

##### Example:
[Comparison >](https://github.com/SchumacherFM/Magento-OpCache/blob/master/modman)
```bash
âžœ php meff.php SchumacherFM_OpCachePanel /var/www/site
FILES IDENTIFIED FOR: SchumacherFM_OpCachePanel
/var/www/site/app/code/community/SchumacherFM/OpCachePanel
/var/www/site/app/etc/modules/SchumacherFM_OpCachePanel.xml
/var/www/site/app/design/adminhtml/default/default/layout/opcachepanel.xml
/var/www/site/app/locale/de_DE/SchumacherFM_OpCachePanel.csv
/var/www/site/app/locale/en_US/SchumacherFM_OpCachePanel.csv
/var/www/site/app/design/adminhtml/default/default/template/opcachepanel/unloaded.phtml
/var/www/site/app/design/adminhtml/default/default/template/opcachepanel/graph.phtml
System config entries: SchumacherFM_OpCachePanel
n98-magerun config:delete system/opcachepanel/api_key_name
n98-magerun config:delete system/opcachepanel/api_key
```

#### Debug Mode:
This extension has some built in debug modes you can enable to see what it is doing behind the scenes. In the `meff.php` file there are two constants you can use to control the debug output.
```bash
    const DEBUG_MODE = true;
    /*
    log levels:
        0 = all
        1 = normal
        2 = file list only
    */
    const DEBUG_LEVEL = 2;
```

#### Caveats:
I haven't tested this on all possible senarios. I appreciate the communities support in testing it with extensions. Magento allows you to construct extensions that can pull files in from a wide variety of sources. I attempt parse the source code looking for mentions of this files and then attempt to determine their existances passed on a few testable assumptions. I'm still working on a few things:
 * Magento allows you to define a helper function to assist in returning a filename using the addItem method. Since this extension currently doesn't instantiate the Magento framework I haven't added this feature.
 * I attempt to pickup any files the extension places in the /lib folder by parsing the source of the php files in the extension and looking for new class declarations. In my tests it is working, but if an issue is found please submit a PR.
 * The code is a bit messy and documentation is limited in some places. I appreciate PR's for refactoring.
